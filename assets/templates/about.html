      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>Logical Books was founded to bring clarity and calm to small business finances. After years supporting founders and finance teams, we saw how accurate, approachable bookkeeping helps leaders sleep better and grow faster.</p>
      <p>Today we support service businesses, e‑commerce brands, and local companies with monthly bookkeeping and insightful management reporting—always on time, always explained in simple, friendly terms.</p>
      <p>Behind the scenes, we use our proprietary Logical Books platform to reduce manual work, spot issues early, and share insights faster—while keeping your data private and secure.</p>
