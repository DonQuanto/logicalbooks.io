      <summary>How does pricing work?</summary>
      <p>We scope work based on transaction volume, accounts, and complexity. Most clients choose a fixed monthly plan. Get a tailored quote via our <a href="#/contact">contact form</a>.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Which bookkeeping software do you support?</summary>
      <p>We use our proprietary, in‑house Logical Books platform to manage your books. We don’t maintain client books in third‑party software. If you’re on another system today, we can migrate your data and provide exports and reports for your CPA.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>What is onboarding like?</summary>
      <p>We start with a kickoff call, connect accounts, document processes, and complete a baseline close to confirm data quality.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Do you work with our CPA?</summary>
      <p>Yes. We provide accurate financial statements and documentation your CPA can use for filings. We don’t provide tax preparation or tax advice.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Can you catch up past months?</summary>
      <p>Absolutely. We offer catch‑up projects and will propose a clear timeline with progress updates.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>How do you keep my financial data secure?</summary>
      <p>We use bank-level encryption for all data in transit and at rest. Our platform is SOC 2 compliant, and we follow strict access controls. Your data is never shared with third parties, and we maintain detailed audit logs of all system activity.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>What if I'm not satisfied with the service?</summary>
      <p>We offer a 30-day satisfaction guarantee. If you're not happy with our work in the first month, we'll refund your payment—no questions asked. After that, you can cancel anytime with 30 days' notice, and we'll provide a clean handoff of your records.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Do you work with international businesses?</summary>
      <p>Yes, we work with US-based businesses and can handle multi-currency transactions. However, we specialize in US GAAP accounting standards and work primarily with businesses operating in the United States. If you have international subsidiaries or complex cross-border transactions, let's discuss your specific needs.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Can't I just do this myself with QuickBooks?</summary>
      <p>You absolutely can! Many founders start that way. But most find that bookkeeping takes 15-20 hours per month—time better spent on sales, product, or operations. Plus, mistakes are costly: missed deductions, reconciliation errors, or messy books that slow down tax prep or lender reviews. We handle the details so you can focus on what only you can do.</p>
